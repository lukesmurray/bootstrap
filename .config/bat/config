# a command-line option that you want to pass to `bat` by default. You can
# run `bat --help` to get a list of all possible configuration options.

# Specify desired highlighting theme (e.g. "TwoDark"). Run `bat --list-themes`
# for a list of all available themes

# Enable this to use italic text on the terminal. This is not supported on all
# terminal emulators (like tmux, by default):
--italic-text=always

# Set the tab width to T spaces. Use a width of 0 to pass tabs through directly
--tabs=2

# set terminal width to actaul_width - 2 to accomodate for the Less status bar
# width. without this, bat assumes the terminal width is 2 characters wider
# than it is and lines will wrap strangely
--terminal-width=-2

# use less as the pager
# --line-numbers disables line numbers (BAT handles these internally)
# --quit-if-one-screen closes less but keeps output on screen if the output takes up less than one screen
--pager="less --line-numbers --quit-if-one-screen"
