# FILE FORMAT
# A settings file is made up of lines with the following format:
# 
# 	app_id    UTI    role
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with a # are ignored.
# Lines must be separated by tabs and the file must end with a newline.
# 
# The app_id is a bundle ID representing the application that will act as the handler for documents associated with UTI.  For example:
# 
# 	com.apple.Safari    public.html    all
# 
# would cause duti to set Safari as the default handler in all situations for HTML documents.  A settings file can also contain lines with this
# format:
# 
# 	app_id    url_scheme
# 
# In this case, app_id is again a bundle ID, this time for the application that will act as the default handler for url_scheme.  For example:
# 
# 	org.mozilla.Firefox     ftp
# 
# would cause duti to set Firefox as the handler for "ftp://" URLs.

# ROLES
# Valid roles are defined as follows
# all                application handles all roles for the given UTI.
# viewer             application handles reading and displaying documents with the given UTI.
# editor             application can manipulate and save the item. Implies viewer.
# shell              application can execute the item.
# none               application cannot open the item, but provides an icon for the given UTI.

# FINDING APP IDS
# To find the app id of an application you can use the following command

# lsappinfo list | rg --multiline '("[^"]*?") ASN:.*\n.*bundleID=("[^"]*?")' --replace '$1 $2' --only-matching | sort | fzf

# lsappinfo lists all application state and we use ripgrep to extract the app name and bundle identifiers

# FINDING UTIS
# To find UTIS check apples list of utis
